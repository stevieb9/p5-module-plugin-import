NAME

    Plugin::Simple - Load plugins from files or modules.

SYNOPSIS

        use Plugin::Simple;
    
        # load a plugin module from a file
    
        @plugins = plugins('/path/to/MyModule.pm');
    
        # load all modules under '__PACKAGE__::Plugin' namespace
    
        my @plugins = plugins();
    
        # load all plugins under a specific namespace
    
        @plugins = plugins('Any::Namespace');
    
        # load a plugin module from a file
    
        @plugins = plugins('/path/to/MyModule.pm');
    
        # load/return only the plugins that can perform specific functions
    
        @plugins = plugins(can => ['foo', 'bar]); # foo and bar
    
        # instead of importing 'plugins()', change the name:
    
        use Simple::Plugin sub_name => 'blah';
        @plugins = blah(...);

DESCRIPTION

    There are many plugin modules available on the CPAN, but I wrote this
    one just for fun. It's very simple, extremely lightweight (core only),
    and is extremely minimalistic in what it does.

    It searches for modules in installed packages or non-installed files,
    and loads them (without string eval). You can optionally have us return
    only the plugins that can() perform a specific task.

FUNCTIONS/METHODS

    None. We simply install a plugin() function within the namespace of the
    package that used us. To specify a different sub name, use this module
    as such: use Plugin::Simple sub_name = 'name_of_sub';>.
